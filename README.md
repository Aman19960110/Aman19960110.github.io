## Selected Projects

### [Bankruptcy Prediction in Polish Companies (2009)](https://github.com/Aman19960110/bankruptcy_2009-prediction-poland)
Bankruptcy Prediction in Polish Companies (2009)
A machine learning project built to forecast corporate bankruptcies in Poland using financial statement data. The model combines exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and tree-based classifiers to help stakeholders identify risk earlier and make data-driven decisions.

Problem Statement
Companies face financial distress for many reasons, and detecting bankruptcy early can help investors, regulators, and company management take preventive action. The challenge lies in working with highly imbalanced data, accounting for skewed distributions, and handling multicollinearity among financial ratios. This project aims to predict whether a company will go bankrupt using historical financial ratios.

### [Yeild Curve Modelling](https://github.com/Aman19960110/yeild_curve_modeling)
This project analyzes Indian Government Securities (G-Secs) yields across multiple maturities and compares two yield curve fitting approaches:
1. **Nelson‚ÄìSiegel Model**
2. **Cubic Spline Interpolation**

The aim is to:
- Model the yield curve using short-to-long maturities (6 months to 30 years).
- Compare the fits in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
- Discuss the ethics of smoothing yield curve data.

### **[Options Analytics Dashboard](https://crtoken.streamlit.app/)**
token_live ‚Äì Trading Analysis & POS Visualization
A full-stack dashboard built with Python & Streamlit for analysing NSE derivatives and POS data.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Dynamic generation of CR tokens using custom parameters (expiry month, open interest thresholds, ATM ranges)
‚Ä¢ Excel-based POS upload: compute exposures, show summaries, visualize mark-to-market metrics
‚Ä¢ Interactive charts and dashboards for real-time insights into trading positions
