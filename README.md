## Selected Projects

### ![Yeild Curve Modelling](https://github.com/Aman19960110/yeild_curve_modeling)
This project analyzes Indian Government Securities (G-Secs) yields across multiple maturities and compares two yield curve fitting approaches:
1. **Nelson‚ÄìSiegel Model**
2. **Cubic Spline Interpolation**

The aim is to:
- Model the yield curve using short-to-long maturities (6 months to 30 years).
- Compare the fits in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
- Discuss the ethics of smoothing yield curve data.

### **Options Analytics Dashboard**
- Built with `Plotly` + `Streamlit` to visualize IV, Greeks, and Open Interest across strikes and expiries.
